After decades of working and travelling around the world I was lucky enough to settle in New Zealand almost 15 years ago with my (then!) young family. I am convinced there is nowhere better to put down roots – metaphorical and actual!

I have been working as a gardener for over 10 years. I started small and have built up a loyal and satisfied customer base. Most of my clients have been with me for many years. I enjoy seeing my gardens develop over time, and love the challenge of growing gardens in the salty/windy air of Wellington.

I have completed a couple of house renovations, doing much of the work myself. I have also worked with a landscape gardener for many years and picked up tricks of the trade along the way. Knowing what makes a house stand out from the crowd, when I attend open homes I am often struck by how the exterior of a property often lets it down, and results in a negative first impression for visitors.

There is nothing more satisfying for me than effecting a complete garden transformation. Clearing out the overgrowth to reveal the potential, planning new planting and creating a beautiful space is what I love doing most.

It made sense to pursue what I love and set up Kerb Appeal in September 2020 to use my skills and energy to make the most of peoples’ gardens and outdoor space: the first thing people see when they visit your home.

This is a passion as much as a job. Give me a call if you would like us to collaborate on making your surroundings a pleasant and inspiring place to be.
